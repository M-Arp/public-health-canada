#### Compare with covid19 dataset####
#Note, that this is only a moderately well documented package
#Uncomment and run this to install the COVID19DATA

#devtools::install_github("ccodwg/Covid19CanadaData")
library(Covid19CanadaData)

#This file has covid case counts for health regions, without HRUIDs
# But as of May 21, 2021, this was not working at all. 
#covid<-dl_dataset(uuid='746c01f3-e597-4413-89e0-afa561bf81d8')

#This line downloads the ccodwg timeseries by health region, but it only includes case counts
#The dataset below has more data.
#covid<-read_csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada/master/timeseries_hr/cases_timeseries_hr.csv")

#This appears to download health canada's comprehensive time series by health region
#However, this file does not contain the HRUIDs 
covid<-read_csv(file="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/src/data/covidLive/file_out_v5.csv")
names(covid)
#Note that there are no HR_UID numbers in the covid file.

# THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT TIM'S FILE HAS THE HRUID BUT THE COVID CASE DATA DOES NOT
# WE NEED TO ADD THE HRUID TO THE COVID CASE DATA FILE SO THAT WE CAN THEN LINK THE COVID CASE DATA FILE
# TO THE FSA VIA THE HEALTH REGIONS (HRUID) 

#### Get HHR_UID####
#This file does have the health region names and the hruids
hruid<-read_csv(file="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/src/data/covidLive/covid19-healthregions-hruid.csv")
names(hruid)
#Some inspections
names(covid)
names(hruid)
names(health_regions)

# THE NEED TO MERGE BY HR_UID IS  ALSO NECESSARY BECAUSE THE NAMES IN THE FILES ARE DIFFERENT
# FOR EXAMPLE IN THE covid case set there is this
covid %>% 
  filter(str_detect(health_region, 'Calgary')) #Calgary
# IN THE HRUID FILE THERE IS THIS
hruid%>% 
  filter(str_detect(health_region, 'Calgary')) # Calgary
#AND IN TIM'S FILE THERE IS THIS. 
health_regions %>% 
  filter(str_detect(HR_NAME, "Calgary")) #Calgary Zone
#You see the problem.
# Tim's data has "Caglary Zone"
#But the CCODWG has "Calgary". But, by adding the hruid to the covid case count data, we should 
# then be able to merge with Tim's file that contains FSAs and health region data

#THIS MERGES THE COVID FILE WITH THE HRUID FILE BY THE VARIABLE HEALTH_REGION
